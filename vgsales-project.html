                          This project is focusing on a dataset containing information on video game sales from 1980 to 2020.
                          I wanted to do this project in Excel because I did not have much prior exposure to Pivot Charts and formulas, and I
                          really wanted to try to become more comfortable with them.

What I'd like to look at in this dataset are the sales 
by platform/publisher/genre by year. Since we already 
looked at the ranking, the column can be removed.

The games in this dataset are listed individually, for 
each platform they were released on. So, many game title 
appear more than once depending on the number of platforms 
the game had been released on.

Let's take a closer look at the N/A entries in the 'Year' 
and 'Publisher' columns. Looking back at the error counts, 
we see that the 'Year' column contains 271 N/A's, and the 
'Publisher' column contains 58 N/A's.  I'm curious to see 
if any overlap.  Filtering the data by N/A in both columns
shows 22 results.

Since I am planning on using the 'Year' and 'Publisher'
columns as a major part of my visualizations, it would be 
best to remove all of the data rows that contain N/A.  A 
total of 307 rows will be removed.

The error checking formulas updated as I removed the rows, 
and now show no errors remaining.

Returning to the main dataset, there are a few error items 
to look into.  In the 'Platform' column the entry '2600' 
isn't entirely clear to what platform it is (especially to 
people who may not be familiar with the video game industry 
or it's history). 

In this case '2600' refers to the Atari 2600 gaming system.  
So a "Find & Replace" will be used to correct the entries. 
Since it is the earliest gaming console, sorting by 'Year' 
will aid in viewing the correction.

After scrolling through the first couple of years (about 150 rows) 
another problem appeared.  There is a data entry for a game 
released on the Nintendo DS console in the year 1985.  
This is incorrect because the DS did not exist until 2004.  
An attempt was made to locate the correct release year, but 
was unable to find it. The row will be removed. 

I am unsure how to properly determine similar problems.  
One option I tried was to create a Pivot Table showing 'Platform' 
with the MIN and MAX of 'Year'.  This, at least, allows me to 
look at the date ranges to see if there are any anomalies.  
The date ranges look reasonable to the respective platform, 
so I don't believe there are any other 'Year'/'Platform' issues.

At this point, I'll do some exploratory visualizations to 
better understand the data. Before that, however, I will 
remove the JP/EU/Other sales columns in order to focus on 
the NA_sales.  I kept the 'Global_Sales' column in order to 
create a new column of the percent of NA_Sales of Global_Sales.

I first did graphs of the counts of the Year/Genre/Platform/Publisher.

I'm interested in seeing which genre by publisher had 
the most sales.  Again, due to the number of publishers,
I will limit the results for easier readability.

The final set of Visualizations I'd like to do is to 
look year-by-year.  To do this, I chose to set it up as
a dashboard. The previous limit of >=100 on the previous 
two graphs needed to be changed to 'Top 10' in order
to be able to display the data by year. The static image 
below will be replaced by a video.
